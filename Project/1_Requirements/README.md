# WATER LEVEL INDICATOR

 - The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in  an overhead tank or any other water container.
 - The sensing is done by using a set of nine probes which are placed at nine different levels on the tank walls (with probe 9 to probe 1 placed in increasing order of height, common probe (i.e. a supply carrying probe) is placed at the base of the tank).
 - The level 8 represents the “tank full” condition while level 0 represents the “tank empty” condition.

 - In this project we show the water level indicator using eight transistors which conducts as level rises, a buzzer is also added which will automatically start as the water level becomes full, auto buzzer start with the help of microcontroller. With the help of this project we not only show the level of water on seven segment display but also indicate the water full condition using a buzzer.
