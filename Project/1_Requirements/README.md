#WATER LEVEL INDICATOR
*The Water Level Indicator employs a simple mechanism to detect and indicate the water level in  an overhead tank or any other water container.
*The sensing is done by using a set of nine probes which are placed at nine different levels on the tank walls (with probe 9 to probe 1 placed in increasing order of height, common probe (i.e. a supply carrying probe) is placed at the base of the tank).
*The level 8 represents the “tank full” condition while level 0 represents the “tank empty” condition.
